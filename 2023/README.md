## Talk
* Title: Embracing Randomness: the Intriguing Role of Chance in Science
* Abstract:
```

In this captivating lecture, we explore the fascinating role of chance and
randomness across various scientific disciplines and discover how random
processes underlie phenomena like Brownian motion, turbulence, chaos, cosmic
microwave background fluctuations, Earth's magnetic field reversals, and
chemical reactions. Learn how embracing the almighty chance has led to
groundbreaking insights into the nature of our world and the complex systems
within it.
